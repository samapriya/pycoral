Download tool for system polygon now creates a user copy to allow for all file types. v0.0.8 \u00b6 Better handles stats request. Prints info if AOI exceeds 100 sqkm. v0.0.7 \u00b6 Uses requests head to estimate zip completion for download. Added option to download data in specific format kml,geojson,shp or gpkg. Improved notification for download tool v0.0.6 \u00b6 Added auto version check to the tool. Added a web based readme site for the tool for ease of use. v0.0.5 \u00b6 Captures products available for download for parsing product type. For now chooses default product type only. Product download is more graceful since it checks product UUID and type before download per AOI. v0.0.4 \u00b6 Added aoi-delete capability along with create using GeoJSON and unique name check. Added local timestamp based unique name generator to AOI stats tool and checks to see if mapped area. Stability test across python3.6 to 3.9 and for all OS types built into CI Updated docs and code cleanup.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"changelog/#changelog","text":"","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"changelog/#v010","text":"Better site parsing Better error handling for Download Increase wait time for download to 2 minutes","title":"v0.1.0"},{"location":"changelog/#v009","text":"Better error handling and now users user agent.
